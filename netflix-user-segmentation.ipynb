This insight is valuable for optimizing the user interface and experience for each device type.\n\n**Geography**\n* While Spain dominates three of the clusters, the United States stands out in Cluster 1, which primarily uses laptops. This geographic distinction can guide region-specific content recommendations or marketing strategies.\n\n**Subscription Type & Revenue**\n* Even though the Basic subscription is dominant across all clusters, there are subtle differences in the average monthly revenues, suggesting variations in additional services or content consumption patterns.","metadata":{}}]}
